## Overview

In the era of industrial digitization, the global manufacturing industry is experiencing significant changes, and China, as a major manufacturing country, is actively promoting the transformation from "Made in China" to "Made in China". The realization of industrial digitization and intelligence requires data as the core driving force, however, many industrial enterprises are facing a series of data challenges such as data silos, data latency, complicated protocols, equipment heterogeneity and heavy operation and maintenance work.
Based on this background, Intel and EMQ are working together to launch a joint industrial solution. Integrating EMQ's cloud-side collaboration data foundation software and Intel's data processing, management and visualization tools, the solution helps industrial enterprises realize the integrated collection, connection, movement, processing, storage, analysis and display of the whole process of data processing. For enterprises to solve all kinds of data problems encountered in industrial digital transformation. At present, the joint solution has been applied to some head customers in the smart factory, energy and other industries, and has been recognized by customers, hoping that it will become the cornerstone of intelligent transformation of smart factories, energy and power, petroleum and petrochemical, iron and steel metallurgy and other major scenarios in the future.

## Industrial Joint Solution of Intel and EMQ

## Program Architecture
Intel and EMQ jointly build an industrial IoT data base, with two EMQ products: EMQX, an MQTT message server in the cloud, and NeuronEX (Neuron + eKuiper), a software for device data collection and edge intelligence analysis, which solves the problem of collecting, connecting, pre-processing, and aggregating industrial data from the edge to the cloud. Intel®Edge Insights for Industrial provides database, video, image, and time-series data processing and analytics tools to address the storage, analysis, and presentation needs after data collection.
Through this joint solution, we enable a clear flow of data from the IoT device to the edge and ultimately to the cloud, providing industrial organizations with powerful, secure and scalable data processing and analysis capabilities.
